🚀 My Java Programming Journey Repository
Welcome to my repository documenting my journey and projects as I learn and practice Java programming!

This repository contains code from two main projects I've worked on: a Student Marksheet System and an Invoice Generation Program .

📚 Projects Overview
1. Student Marksheet System
This project is a console-based Java application designed to record and calculate the total marks and average for multiple students in a set of courses. It demonstrates fundamental Java concepts like user input, variable declaration, and basic arithmetic operations.

2. Invoice Generation Program
This project focuses on generating a formatted, console-based invoice or bill. This demonstrates effective use of System.out.println() for structured output and simulating a real-world document format.

🛠️ Technology Used
Language: Java
Core Concepts: Variables, Data Types (String, int, double), Operators, Scanner class for I/O, System.out.println() for output.
💡 What I've Learned
Through these projects, I've solidified my understanding of:

Data Types and Casting: Ensuring correct data types for calculations (e.g., using 
7.0
 for average calculation to get a double result). Input Handling in Java: The crucial practice of handling the newline character in the Scanner after reading numerical input (nextInt()) to prevent issues when subsequently reading line input (nextLine()).

Code Structure: Organizing code within public class Main and public static void main(String[] args).
Output Formatting: Using simple string manipulation to create professional, tabular, and well-aligned console output.
⏭️ Next Steps
Refactor the Student Marksheet System to use Arrays or ArrayLists to handle an arbitrary number of students, rather than hardcoding variables for 5 students.
Implement the dynamic input logic for the Invoice Generation Program (Main.java) based on the input screenshots, ensuring the amounts, tax, and totals are calculated accurately instead of being hardcoded strings.
Introduce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like Classes (e.g., Student class and Product class) to make the code more scalable and maintainable.
